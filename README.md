# Interactive Quiz Application

## üìù Project Description

This project is part of my 6-week internship at **Codetech IT Solutions**, under the guidance of **Mr. Neela Santosh**, in the domain of **Front-End Development**. The goal of this project was to design and build an **Interactive Quiz Application** using core web technologies: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

### üéØ Objective

The objective was to create a user-friendly quiz platform where users can:

- Read a question
- Choose an answer from multiple options
- Get immediate feedback on their selection
- See their total score at the end

### üß± Technologies Used

- **HTML** ‚Äì for structuring the application
- **CSS** ‚Äì for designing a responsive and clean interface
- **JavaScript** ‚Äì for handling logic and interactivity

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Process

I started by building the structure of the application using semantic HTML. This included:

- A title
- A container for questions
- A dynamic list of options
- Feedback and result sections

After structuring the page, I styled it using **CSS**, focusing on:

- Centering the quiz container with Flexbox
- Adding shadows, spacing, and hover effects
- Making the interface clean and easy to use

The core logic was implemented using **JavaScript**. I created an array of question objects, each containing the question text, options, and the correct answer. I then wrote functions to:

- Display the current question and options
- Detect and validate user selection
- Provide instant feedback (correct/incorrect)
- Track the score and display the result at the end

I also used JavaScript to control visibility of the result box and question area by toggling a `.hidden` class.

### üîÅ Version Control

All development was done using **Git** for version control. I regularly committed changes and pushed them to a **GitHub repository**, resolving issues like remote conflicts and merge histories during the process.

### ‚úÖ Outcome

This project helped me gain practical experience in:

- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Responsive design
- Git and GitHub workflows

It improved my problem-solving skills and prepared me for real-world front-end development challenges.
